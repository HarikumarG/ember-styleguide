# CSS Helper Classes

## dark

if you would like a section or a div to use the dark style then you need to add `class="dark"` to the element that you would like to be dark. This helper class sets the background to the dark colour and automatically sets the text colour to be white

```html
<div class="dark">
  hello there
</div>
```
