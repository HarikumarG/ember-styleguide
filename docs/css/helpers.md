# CSS Helper Classes

## dark

if you would like a section or a div to use the dark style then you need to add `class="dark"` to the element that you would like to be dark. This helper class sets the background to the dark colour and automatically sets the text colour to be white

```html
<div class="dark">
  hello there
</div>
```

## margins

If you would like to add a bit of margin to the bottom or left of something (for example in a vertical or horizontal list) there are two simple helpers to add a small amount of margin: `margin-bottom-small` and `margin-left-small`.

```html
<ul>
  <li class="margin-bottom-small">One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<button>One</button>
<button class="margin-left-small">Two</button>
<button>Three</button>
```
